This file contains all the code used to predict the onset of atrial fibrillation using machine learning methods for the SSC Case Competition in Saskatoon in May 2025.

I will not be disclosing the dataset as I have signed an NDA protecting confidentiality of the dataset used in the competition.

Files coming soon.
